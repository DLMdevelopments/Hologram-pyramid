# Interaction system based on an avatar projected on a pyramidal display
A system based on 3D virtual head is presented, which uses a pyramidal display to project an Avatar that can interact with the environment. 
The system is developed in ROS (Robotic Operating System). The facial expressions generator subsystem is based on the communication of several nodes, which is controlled by a graphic interface.
